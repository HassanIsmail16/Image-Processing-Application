#  Image Processing Application
This repository is used to develop an `image processing application` as a part of the Structured Programming course's third assignment provided by [FCAI Cairo University](https://fcai.cu.edu.eg/).

Team Members: [Hassan Ali](https://github.com/HassanIsmail16), [Momen Abd El-Kader](https://github.com/Momen-Abdelkader), and [Mohamed Ali](https://github.com/MoAli488).

The image processing in this application is done by manipulating RGB values or the position of each pixel in images and using fundamental image processing concepts such as convolution theory, kernels, and color spaces to achieve the desired result. The image class used to perform operations on images is provided as a part of the assignment's material.

The application contains the following:
- `Basic Filters` : Grayscale, Black and White, Invert Image Colors, Sunlight Filter, Purple Overlay, Infrared, and Old TV Filter.
- `Complex Filters` : Adding a Frame, Edge Detection, Blur, and Oil Painting.
- `Image Transformations` : Merge, Flip, Rotate, Crop, Resize, and Skew.
- `Image Adjustments` : Brightness, Saturation and Contrast.
